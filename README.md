# LethalFlare
Contains the files for a purchasable flare item in Lethal Company

The flare is a 12 credit item that can be bought. It is a one time use item that emits light, sound, and a smoke column for roughly half of an in-game day (5 minutes). 
The flare can be thrown if you're too scared to walk in the dark.

The current state of the flare does not sync state changes over multiplayer/networked lobbies, regardless of which behavior file is used. 
Some remnant attempts at networking remain in the files, which should either be ignored and removed, or modified to actually work. 

Some things to address in the future: 

Proper networking for multiplayer, 
The flare sometimes clips through catwalks,
A nice little animation for igniting the flare and throwing it
